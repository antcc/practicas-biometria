In this work, Gaussian blur and Gaussian noise are used as our image pre-processing methods. Adding Gaussian blur and Gaussian noise can both changelow level pixel statistics, which serve well for our purpose of depressing low levelunstable clues. In order to increase the diversity of training samples, we applyrandom extent of these preprocessings. The kernel size of Gaussian blur is ran-domly chosen from 1, 3, 5 and 7 for each training batch. Similarly, the standarddeviation  of  Gaussian  noise  is  randomly  set  between  0  and  5  for  each  batch.Note that Gaussian blur of kernel 1 and Gaussian noise of 0 deviation result inno change to the original images.
